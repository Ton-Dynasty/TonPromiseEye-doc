# Our Features

## Our Mission

Our mission is to empower users to subscribe to signals for various events through Eventon and automatically execute user-defined actions when these events occur. These events can encompass both on-chain contract events, such as De-Fi protocol transactions or Oracle updates, and off-chain events, such as smart contract vulnerability detections.

### Use Cases

1. **Address Tracking**: Users can subscribe to specific addresses and configure Eventon to automatically perform actions, such as mirroring or reversing trades when these addresses emit transaction signals.

2. **De-Fi Protocol Integration**: Users can subscribe to a De-Fi protocol and instruct Eventon to automatically claim APY rewards when specific signals are emitted by the De-Fi protocol.

3. **Oracle Automation**: Users can subscribe to an Oracle and set Eventon to automatically execute actions, such as buying or selling ETH, when the Oracle emits an ETH price of $1600 USD.

4. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Users can subscribe to a smart contract and instruct Eventon to automatically claim airdrops or NFTs when specific signals are emitted by the smart contract, such as airdrop distributions or NFT releases.

5. **Off-chain Signal Handling**: Users can subscribe to off-chain external signals, and when these signals are sent to Eventon, it can automatically execute user-defined actions, such as flagging warning addresses or configuring investment portfolios.

## Our Advantages

1. **Open-Source Protocol**: Eventon operates as an open-source protocol, welcoming anyone to subscribe to signals for diverse events and trigger custom actions upon event occurrences.

2. **Decentralization**: Eventon is a decentralized protocol, conducting all operations through smart contracts, thereby eliminating the dependence on centralized services.

3. **User-Friendly**: Eventon prioritizes user-friendliness, making it accessible and comprehensible even for individuals with no programming experience.

4. **Broad Event Support**: Eventon boasts extensive event support, accommodating both on-chain contract events and off-chain events. Integrating an event into Eventon necessitates only the addition of a message-sending function to existing code and the provision of the signal's ABI, all without the need for altering the existing architecture.

# Add Stake for Earn

## What Is Add Stake for Earn?

On the Eventon Protocol, every signal source requires a stake, which is jointly provided by the signal source and any user. Users can use their stake to share in the earnings.

## How Much Can I Earn?

The Eventon Protocol distributes all earnings among all stakes, and the earnings for each stake are allocated in proportion to the quantity of stake. For example, if a user possesses 10% of the total stake, they will receive 10% of the earnings.
